Rainfall Prediction Using Machine Learning

Introduction
This project aims to develop accurate rainfall prediction models using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing historical weather data and employing various data preprocessing and modeling techniques, the project seeks to enhance the robustness and reliability of rainfall forecasts. The models are evaluated to identify the best-performing algorithm for accurate predictions.

Requirements
Python 3.7+
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rainfall-prediction.git
cd rainfall-prediction


Create a virtual environment and activate it:

python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate


Install the required packages:


pip install -r requirements.txt



Model Evaluation
The model evaluation process involves assessing the performance of different machine learning algorithms using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared. Visualization techniques are used to compare the predicted rainfall values against the actual values.

Results
The results of the best-performing model, along with visualizations and evaluation metrics, are saved in the results/ directory. The findings indicate that the selected model demonstrates a high level of accuracy and reliability in predicting rainfall.
